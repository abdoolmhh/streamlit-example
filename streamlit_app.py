    This app is designed to help you analyze and optimize your network data using different criteria. 
    You can upload a csv file that contains two columns: source and target, representing the nodes and edges of your network. 
    You can choose an optimization criterion from the sidebar, such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, or PageRank. 
    The app will optimize your network based on the chosen criterion and display a visualization of the optimized network. 
    The app will also generate a feedback based on the network analysis and optimization. 
    You can also choose to show some basic network statistics, such as number of nodes, number of edges, density, diameter, and average clustering coefficient. 
    For more information about network analysis and optimization, you can refer to these sources:

- NetworkX Documentation
- Streamlit Documentation
- Network Analysis Made Simple
